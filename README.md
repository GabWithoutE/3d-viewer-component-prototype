# Prototype Image Based Animation Viewer

This project is a prototype for a 3d viewer, similar to the ones found on the product pages on Apple's website. The core of this project is a component that displays different images based on the scroll position.

Notably, there's also an implementation of a custom hook that preloads the image resources, such that images needed in the viewer can be displayed without repeated network calls.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
